Keeping track of inventory data is a monumental task.  And there are plenty of tools to help organizations.  Tools range from enterprise systems for large organizations to pre-made solutions accessed via the web (Software as a Service or SaaS), which might be perfect for small businesses.  Of course, not all companies fit into these two categories.  Fortunately, there are a number of rapid application software platforms that can be used to affordably create custom inventory solutions.
    
One of those tools is the FileMaker Platform.  The software has been around since the early 80's, having been owned by both Microsoft and Apple (at different times, of course).  The FileMaker platform runs on Windows, Mac, iOS (iPhone, iPod, and iPad) as well as the web.  It is currently a subsidiary of Apple.
    
    
This site is a collection of articles on building Inventory Management Systems (IMS) with the FileMaker Platform.  It is written specifically for two primary groups:
    
1. Citizen developers (e.g. business owner, operations manager, IT director, etc.) who want to use FileMaker's ease of use and rapid development environment to create their own IMS.
2. FileMaker Pro developers who haven't yet built an IMS.
