I was curious about the FileMaker Starter Solution for Inventory management in recent versions and I thought it would fun to create an article showing its evolution (at least from version 11 through 18).  There's a change in version 17, which I describe below.

I think all the files are interesting to open, reverse engineer, see different techniques.  **However, I do not recommend starting an inventory project with these files!**  They simply aren't robust enough.

The screenshots are only in Mac, but of course, FileMaker also runs on Windows.

Enjoy!

## Starter vs. Sample
Starting with version 17, FileMaker Inc. (FMI) made two inventory files available.  One called a Starter and the other called a Sample.  The distinction, according to FMI,is that the Sample apps show the possibilities of what can be done.  The presumption, then, is that the Starter is a file to base your project.

Frankly, I don't find this distinction helpful at all.  The sample file appears to be the same as version 15 (not 16), with three tables: Inventory, Company Info, and Stock Transactions.  The Starter file only has two tables: Products and Inventory Transactions.  By contrast, my ![FM Inventory Starter file](https://www.fminventorystarter.com/) has 40 tables (plus a table template, which I didn't count).

The noticeable difference is that one seems to be designed for the desktop (Sample) and the other for the iPad (Starter).  There's also a slight difference in table and field names.
