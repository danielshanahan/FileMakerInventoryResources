I was curious about the FileMaker Starter Solution for Inventory management in recent versions and I thought it would fun to create an article showing its evolution (at least from version 11 through 15).  Iâ€™m not going to comment on the solutions.  Rather, this is simply a place to see the item detail view in its different iterations.

The screenshots are only in Mac, but of course, FileMaker also runs on Windows.

Enjoy!
