# Variant
![](../assets/images/fmp_variants.png)


This file demonstrates one way to create variants from a master product.  Create an item and mark the checkbox Has Variants.  In the Variant List field list all the variants in the following naming convention:

Variant 1: {Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc.}
Variant 2: {Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc.}
Variant 3: {Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc.}

For example, 
Color: {Blue, Black, Orange}
Size: {Large, Small}

You can have as many options inside a set as you like (a set is defined by the  curly braces “{}” ).

You can have as many variants as you like.
