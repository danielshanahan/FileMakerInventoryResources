![Item Substitution](http://newleafdata.com/images/fmp_BOMTreeBasic.png)

This is a free download in support of the BOM Tree article.  The file is called "Basic" though it is anything but basic.  It creates a full tree, showing the dependancies in one view.  It also shows how many units are required, how many are available, how many unite can be made, and how many can be sold.

Another BOM Tree file - called a "Pro" version - is available for download in the Store section, also on the FileMaker Inventory Resources home page.

*The download link for this file is sent via email after submitting the "Updates and Downloads" form.  If you didn't receive that welcome email, please let me know at daniel@newleafdata.com*
