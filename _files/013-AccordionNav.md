The new Card window in FileMaker 16 brought a number of interesting possibilities.  One of those is an accordion navigation menu.  The design is common in many data driven web and desktop applications.  The advantage in FileMaker is the navigation information is located in one place, so a change to the menu does not require updates on multiple layouts, as it currently does with horizontal button bar navigation.
