This is a free download in support of the Universal Data Model series of articles.  It shows the combination of vendors (or suppliers) with customers into a universal table called COMPANY.  It also shows the combination of various order tables such as Purchase Order, Sales Order, Work Order, etc. into a universal table called ORDER.

Those familiar with the Universal Data Model will notice that it does not include a Party Model, which is addressed in article  ![Universal Data Model - Company](http://filemakerinventoryresources.com/Universal-Data-Model-Company.html).
