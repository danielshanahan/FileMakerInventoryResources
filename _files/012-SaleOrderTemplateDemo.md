This demonstrates a couple of things:

1. How to create and use a template order to speed up data entry for common orders.

2. How to use a universal table - in this case, ORDER - for various data sets.  Both the sales order and the template records are stored in ORDER and ORDERLINE.  When navigating to the respective layout, a trigger filters the data so the user only sees sales order data on the sales order layout and template data on the template layout.  The same technique can be used for purchase orders, work orders, etc.

This is a free download that demonstrates two methods for handling backorders in the sales order module.
